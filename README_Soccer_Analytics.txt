# Real-Time Soccer Analytics Pipeline

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a real-time data pipeline to track player movements and match events in soccer. The pipeline simulates player activity data (e.g., location, speed, possession) and real-time match events (e.g., goals, fouls, passes). It processes, stores, and visualizes these insights to provide real-time analytics.

## Key Features:
- **Real-time Data Ingestion** using Apache Kafka for streaming match and player data.
- **Real-time Data Processing** with Apache Spark Streaming to clean and aggregate events.
- **Data Storage** in Google BigQuery or AWS Redshift for scalable querying and analysis.
- **Data Transformation** using dbt to model metrics like possession, distance covered, and player heatmaps.
- **Data Visualization** in Google Data Studio or Tableau Public for real-time dashboarding.

## Technologies Used:
- Apache Kafka
- Apache Spark Streaming
- Google BigQuery / AWS Redshift
- dbt (Data Build Tool)
- Google Data Studio / Tableau Public

## Project Steps:

### 1. Data Ingestion
- Simulated real-time data on player movements and match events is ingested into Apache Kafka.
- **Source**: Football API or simulated historical data.

### 2. Data Processing
- Spark Streaming processes the data in real time, aggregating match events and calculating player metrics (e.g., total distance covered, possession time).
  
### 3. Data Storage
- Processed data is stored in Google BigQuery or AWS Redshift.
- Data is partitioned by match, team, and player for efficient querying.

### 4. Data Transformation
- dbt is used to further model the data and calculate key metrics (e.g., player heatmaps, possession percentages).

### 5. Data Visualization
- Dashboards in Google Data Studio or Tableau Public display real-time match insights, player statistics, and key performance indicators.

## How to Run the Project:

1. **Kafka Setup**:
   - Install and configure Kafka locally or in the cloud.
   - Create the necessary Kafka topics (e.g., `soccer-match-events`).

2. **Simulating Data**:
   - Use the Python script `soccer_data_simulator.py` to generate player movement and event data and send it to Kafka.

3. **Spark Streaming**:
   - Run `spark_streaming_job.py` to process the real-time data and store it in BigQuery/Redshift.

4. **Data Transformation**:
   - Run `dbt` models to calculate key metrics (e.g., distance covered, possession).

5. **Visualize Data**:
   - Connect BigQuery/Redshift to Google Data Studio or Tableau Public to create interactive dashboards.
